# PasaheroGuide

**One stop site for your commuting needs!**

As a *probinsyana*, I always feel anxious whenever I travel from my province to the Metro. I fear that I might take the wrong bus or get off the wrong stop or worse, get lost in the city and never reach my destination.

Therefore, I decided to develop this website for people who is commuting for the first time, for people who often ride the public transpo, for people like me.

**PasaheroGuide** will initially have this function:

* Filipino-style of giving directions:
    * "Sakay ka ng *(jeep/tricycle/bus/van)* na byaheng *(location)*. Tapos..."
    * "'Wag mo itatanong kung magkano, mag-bigay ka ng *(specific amount of fare)*."

And so on... Experienced commuters can create an account to provide helpful steps and help other fellow commuters to arrive on their desired destination with confidence. 

However, this is just a silly project idea (thanks to someone who adviced me to relieve my pressure as a *tambay with a degree* and start building my portfolio first through pet projects) which I will strive to develop to have a range of functionalities that will be useful to the Filipino commuters. 

Nonetheless, I would still update my progress here. For now, annyeong!
